The resultant of two vectors, calculated by adding respective components of
each vector is called vector sum.

```c
1. Check how many compute devices are attached.
2. Select device with atleast compute capability 1.3.
```

```bash
# OUTPUT
Current CUDA device: 0
CUDA device with atleast compute capability 1.3: 0

Cards that have compute capability 1.3 or higher
support double-precision floating-point math.
```

See [main.cu] for code.
